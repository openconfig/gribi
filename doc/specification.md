# 1 Introduction

This document defines the specification for the gRPC Routing Information Base
Interface (gRIBI). gRIBI is a gRPC-based protocol for injecting routing entries
to an network device. The gRIBI implementation on an network device is presented
as a service that can be interacted with by an external process, which may be an
element of an SDN controller.

This document is expected to read in conjunction with the protobuf definition of
the gRIBI service, and its associated items (e.g., OpenConfig AFT model). The
intention of this specification is to cover detailed discussion beyond the scope
of the comments included in these files, rather than to exhaustively cover every
field therein.

Terminology used in this document:

*   Device - refers to an network device that presents the gRIBI service.
*   Server - refers to the gRIBI server implementation on the device.
*   Client - refers to a gRIBI client implementation that is usually running
    externally to the device.
*   gRIBI entry - refers to an entry that can be injected to a network device
    via gRIBI, e.g., an IPv4 prefix, a next hop group, or a next hop, etc. (see
    the `entry` field in `AFTOperation.entry` message).
*   AFT operation - refers to the operation (e.g., add an next hop) carried in
    an `AFTOperation` message.

# 2 Data Model

gRIBI uses the
[OC (OpenConfig) AFT model](https://github.com/openconfig/public/tree/master/release/models/aft)
as an abstracted view of the device RIB. Using the same schema as the OC AFT
model simplifies gRIBI injection service as much as possible. It guarantees that
injected gRIBI entries are mappable to the existing gNMI `Get` and `Subscribe`
RPCs for retrieving and streaming AFT entries.

The YANG model is transformed to Protobuf
([gribi_aft.proto](https://github.com/openconfig/gribi/blob/master/v1/proto/gribi_aft/gribi_aft.proto))
to be carried within the payload of gRIBI RPCs. The process of machine
translating YANG to Protobuf is implemented in the
[ygot](https://github.com/openconfig/ygot) library.

# 3 Encryption, Authentication and Authorization.

Currently gRIBI does not define its own specification for encryption,
authentication and authorization, but leverages the underlying gRPC support.

# 4 Service Definition

The gRIBI service is a single gRPC service defined in
[`gribi.proto`](https://github.com/openconfig/gribi/blob/master/v1/proto/service/gribi.proto).
It includes three RPCs:

*   `Modify` - defined in [4.1](#41-modify-rpc), used by the clients to make
    changes to the device's RIB.
*   `Flush` - defined in [4.2](#42-get-rpc), used by clients to remove gRIBI
    entries on a device in bulk.
*   `Get` - defined in [4.3](#43-flush-rpc), used by clients to retrieve the
    current set of installed gRIBI entries.

IANA has reserved
[TCP port 9340](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=9340#Google_Networking)
for the gRIBI service.

## 4.1 `Modify` RPC

The `Modify` RPC is a bidirectional streaming RPC for clients to modify the
device's RIB. A client sends `ModifyRequest` messages that contain a set of
`AFTOperation` messages to the device. The device processes the received
requests and responds to them asynchronously.

The `ModifyRequest` message is used for session negotation, to inform a
target device of the result of an external election, or to supply operations
to modify the device's RIB. These operations are described in detail below.
Only one of these usages is valid within a single message - such that it is
an error for more than one of the `params`, `election_id` or `operation` fields
to be populated in the same message. In the case that a client sends such a
message, the device should respond with the `INVALID_ARGUMENT` canonical RPC
status code.

### 4.1.1 Client-Server Session Negotiation

A gRIBI client is identified by `Modify` RPC streams, i.e., if an RPC drops or
is cancelled and reconnects with the same `election_id` value, it will be
considered as another client.

Before a client starts sending `AFTOperation` messages, it should specify the
desired parameters for the session:

*   Redundancy Mode - defined in [4.1.4](#414-redundancy-mode)
*   Persistence Mode - defined in [4.1.5](#415-persistence-modes)
*   Acknowledgement Mode - defined in [4.1.6](#416-acknowledge-mode)

A client starts the negotiation process by sending the first `ModifyRequest`
message with only `params` populated. `params` MUST NOT be sent more than once
during the lifetime of the RPC session.

Since clients that are programming the same server are expected to implement
common modes of operation, servers are not required to support all combinations.
Particularly, for the parameters described in `params` (i.e., persistence,
election and acknowledgement modes), servers need only support one common mode
across all clients. Therefore, all clients MUST send the same values of all the
attributes of`params`.

If the device can process and support the requested parameters, it should
respond with `ModifyResponse` that has `session_params_result.status = OK`.
Otherwise, the device should close the `Modify` RPC and set the generic gRPC
[`Status.code`][gRPC status code] per the following scenarios:

*   If any of the requested parameters is not supported by the server, set
    `Status.code` to `UNIMPLEMENTED`. The `Status.details` should contain
    `ModifyRPCErrorDetails` message with `reason` set to `UNSUPPORTED_PARAMS`.
*   If the requested `params` does not match the parameters of other live
    `Modify` RPC sessions, set the `Status.code` to `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The
    `Status.details` should contain `ModifyRPCErrorDetails` message with
    `reason` set to `PARAMS_DIFFER_FROM_OTHER_CLIENTS`.
*   If other cases, set the `Status.code` to `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The
    `Status.details` should contain `ModifyRPCErrorDetails` message with
    appropriate `reason` populated.

It is possible that the client skips the negotiation step. In this case, the
first `ModifyRequest` message from the client contains `operation` but not
`params`. The device will assume the default parameters are requested by the
client. If any of the default parameters is not supported by the device, the
device should close the `Modify` RPC upon receiving the first `ModifyRequest`
message, and the device should set the generic gRPC
[`Status.code`][gRPC status code] to `UNIMPLEMENTED`. The `Status.details`
should contain `ModifyRPCErrorDetails` message with `reason` set to
`UNSUPPORTED_PARAMS`. The following are the default parameters:

*   `redundancy` = `ALL_PRIMARY`.
*   `persistence` = `DELETE`
*   `ack_type` = `RIB_ACK`

### 4.1.2 Election ID

The Election ID informs the device of the result of an external election amongst
the clients connected to it. The semantics of this election are further defined
in [4.1.4.1](#4141-client-election-in-single_primary).

Election ID should only be used in `SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode. If the agreed
redundancy mode is `ALL_PRIMARY`, but a client populates either
`ModifyRequest.election_id` or `AFTOperation.election_id`, the device should
close the `Modify` RPC and set `Status.code` to `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The
`Status.details` should contain `ModifyRPCErrorDetails` message with `reason`
set to `ELECTION_ID_IN_ALL_PRIMARY`.

There are two fields for election ID:

*   `ModifyRequest.election_id` is to indicate the clients election result. It
    should only be populated when the client's election ID changed after an
    election result (election is defined in
    [4.1.4.1](#4141-client-election-in-single_primary)).
*   `AFTOperation.election_id` is consumed by the server to determine whether
    the source of a request matches the latest election ID. This allows the
    server to reject clients that believe they are the current primary, but have
    been supplanted, due to a split-brain between clients. In `SINGLE_PRIMARY`
    mode, an `AFTOperation` message should always have the `election_id`
    populated.

In `SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode, the device processes the `AFTOperation` only if all
the following conditions met:

*   The `AFTOperation.election_id` is equal to the `ModifyRequest.election_id`
    last advertised by the client.
*   The `AFTOperation.election_id` has the highest value amongst all the
    election IDs that the device knows about, i.e., the client is the primary
    client.

Otherwise, the device discards the `AFTOperation` message and returns a
`ModifyResponse` message with `result` set to `FAILED`.

`ModifyRequest.election_id` MUST be non zero. When a device receives an value of
0, it should close the `Modify` RPC and set `Status.code` to `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
The election ID can only be increased monotonically by a client during a RPC
session. This simplifies server implementation.

#### 4.1.2.1 Election ID Reset

There is no motivation to provide any way for clients to reset the election ID
on the device since it is expected to be determined through a stable election
mechanism. In the scenario that a client were to lose track of the highest
election ID known by the device, the value can be learned via the
`ModifyResponse.election_id` from the device, by sending a `ModifyRequest` with
`ModifyRequest.election_id` set to the lowest possible value (1) (see
[4.1.4.1](#4141-client-election-in-single_primary) for more details).

It is possible that in some scenarios (e.g., daemon crash, device reboot) the
device might lose the highest learned election ID and hence unset it. However, a
device SHOULD NOT promptly reset the value in any cases (e.g., all clients
disconnect). This helps reduce the chance of non-primary client programming the
device in some failure scenarios (e.g., some error happens on clients side that
might lead to split-brain among clients and also cause all clients disconnect
and then reconnect).

### 4.1.3 AFT Operation

A client expresses modifications to the RIB by sending a set of `AFTOperation`
messages. Three types of operations are supported:

*   `ADD` - creates an entry. If the entry already exists in the specified RIB
    table, the `ADD` SHOULD be treated as replacing the existing entry with the
    entry specified in the operation.
*   `REPLACE` - replaces an existing entry in the specified RIB table. It MUST
    fail if the entry does not exist. A replace operation should contain all of
    the relevant fields, such that existing entry is completely replaced with
    the specified entry.
*   `DELETE` - removes an entry from the specified RIB table.

An AFT Operation is identified by its `id` in the `AFTOperation` message. The
`AFTOperation.id` should be unique per `Modify` RPC session. It's the client's
responsibility to guarantee the uniqueness during a `Modify` RPC session.

#### 4.1.3.1 AFT Operation Content Validation

It is the clients' responsibility to ensure the correctness of AFT operation
content, and being conservative in what they send. The device should process AFT
operations per the received order and process each AFT operation atomically, and
is only required to perform the following validations:

*   Message syntax validation.
*   Entry reference validation (e.g. the referenced NHG is installed). This
    should also catch the case where out of order AFT operation reference
    happens).

Failed validation should return a `ModifyResponse` message with `result` set to
`FAILED`.

#### 4.1.3.2 AFT Operation Response

The device executes the received AFT operations and streams the results to the
sender (a gRIBI client) via a list of `AFTResult` messages in `ModifyResponse`.

*   Each AFT operation should be responded individually. The device MUST NOT
    stream the results to clients other than the sender (see
    [4.1.1](#411-client-server-session-negotiation) for client identification).
*   The device SHOULD NOT close the RPC session due to errors encountered
    processing an AFT operation. The errors should be responded to with in-band
    error messages within the stream (see `AFTResult` below).

An `AFTResult` message MUST have the following fields populated by the device:

*   `id` - indicates which AFT Operation this message is about. It corresponds
    to the `id` field of the received `AFTOperation` message.
*   `status` - records the execution result of the AFT operation. It can have
    one of the following values. Note, not all `status` values are available in
    every acknowledgement mode ([4.1.6](#416-acknowledge-mode) defines
    acknowledgement mode).
    *   `FAILED` - indicates that the AFT operation can not be programmed into
        the RIB (e.g. missing reference, invalid content, semantic errors, etc).
        *   Available in all acknowledge modes.
    *   `RIB_PROGRAMMED` - indicates that the AFT operation was successfully
        programmed into the RIB.
        *   Available in all acknowledge modes.
        *   OPTIONAL in the case that the server is running in `FIB_PROGRAMMED`
            acknowledgement mode.
    *   `FIB_PROGRAMMED` - indicates that the AFT operation was successfully
        programmed into the FIB. "Programmed into the FIB" is defined as the
        forwarding entry being operational in the underlying forwarding
        resources across the system that it is relevant to (e.g., all linecards
        that host a particular VRF etc).
        *   Only available in the `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK` acknowledge mode.
        *   Implies that the AFT operation was also successfully programmed into
            the RIB.
    *   `FIB_FAILED` - indicates that the AFT operation was meant to be
        programmed into the FIB but the device failed to do it.
*   `timestamp` - records the time at which the gRIBI daemon received and
    processed the result from the underlying systems in the device. The typical
    use for this timestamp is to provide tracking of programming
    [service level indicators](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos).

In `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK` acknowledgement mode, it's possible that a gRIBI entry is
installed in the RIB, but is not the preferred route (e.g., there is a static
route for the same matching entry), and therefore the gRIBI entry will not be
programmed into the FIB. In this case, the device should only respond with the
`status` value `RIB_PROGRAMMED`.

##### 4.1.3.2.1 Idempotent DELETE

The behavior of AFT operation `DELETE` MUST be idempotent as to the device
RIB/FIB state. In addition, the idempotent behavior should also cover the
response. For example, if the entry does not exist, the device should return
`FIB_PROGRAMMED` (in the session of `ack_type=RIB_AND_FIB_ACK`).

It is normal and expected that controllers might send repeated `DELETE`, or send
a `DELETE` while one is still pending processing on the device. Having this
behavior simplifies the implementation, instead of overloading `FAILED` or
disconnecting the `Modify` RPC with errors.

##### 4.1.3.2.2 Coalesced AFT operations

In some scenarios, a device might coalesce multiple RIB or FIB programming
operations (i.e., southbound changes towards the device's RIB and forwarding
tables) on a given gRIBI entry and only execute the last one. This would be
primarily done for performance optimization.

In this case, as long as the session is still up and the client is still the
primary client, the device MUST respond to each individual AFT operation from
the same primary client (regardless of whether the downstream programming
operation was coalesced).

This is required in order to:

*   Keep the API behavior clear and consistent.
*   Allow the sender (client) to avoid tracking the content of the pending AFT
    operations.

Responding to each individual AFT operation does not present a significant cost,
because the server/device already has context of all pending AFT operations.
However, it does raise the question as to whether the AFT operation has ever
modified the RIB or FIB. This is not currently considered as a core
requirement - since the expectation is that clients care about the latest state
of either table.

#### 4.1.3.3 Life cycle of an AFT operation

The life of an AFT operation starts when a client creates it, and ends in the
following scenarios:

*   The device failed to program the operation into RIB (returns `FAILED`).
*   `ack_type` = `RIB_ACK`, the device programmed the operation into RIB
    successfully (returns `RIB_PROGRAMMED`).
*   `ack_type` = `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK`, the device programmed the operation into FIB
    successfully (returns `FIB_PROGRAMMED`).
*   `ack_type` = `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK`, the device has successfully programmed the
    operation into RIB but failed to program it into FIB (returns `FIB_FAILED`).
    Note that this is regardless if a device is going to retry the FIB
    programming or not. The client can promptly send another AFT operation for
    explicit behaviors (e.g. `ADD` for retry, and `DELETE` for stopping retry).
*   The existing gRPC session is disconnected/canceled. All pending AFT
    operations from the client should be cancelled.
*   The device has discovered a change in the elected primary (see
    [4.1.4.2](#4142-new-primary-election-in-single_primary) for more details).

Only during the life cycle should the device keep the client updated via
`AFTResult` message in `ModifyResponse`.

### 4.1.4 Redundancy Mode

`Modify` can operate in one of the following redundancy modes
([4.1.1](#411-client-server-session-negotiation) defines how the mode is agreed
between client and server):

*   `SINGLE_PRIMARY`: The device accepts AFT operations from the primary client
    only. The device discards AFT operations received from non-primary client
    and respond error (see [4.1.2](#412-election-id) for details).
*   `ALL_PRIMARY`: The device accepts AFT operations from all clients.

#### 4.1.4.1 Client Election In `SINGLE_PRIMARY`

gRIBI server does not participate in the election process, rather it consumes
the election result. The election result is reflected in the
`ModifyRequest.election_id` sent by clients. Particularly, the "winner" on an
election with ID = `X` is the only client that should both update the current
election ID with value `X`, and use it in subsequent programming operations. The
gRIBI server treats the client of the highest election ID as the primary client.

When a client is elected as the leader (i.e., "wins" a new election), the client
should send a `ModifyRequest` containing the ID of the election that it "won" to
the server. This update should be sent regardless of whether the client was
previously the leader, or not. with only the `ModifyRequest.election_id`
populated. The device should respond with a `ModifyResponse` that has only the
`election_id` field populated. The `ModifyResponse.election_id` by the server
should be the highest election ID that the device has learnt from any client.

If the `ModifyRequest.election_id` sent by a client matches the previous highest
value, the newer client is considered primary. This allows for a client to
reconnect without an external election having taken place. It is gRIBI clients'
responsibility to avoid more than one `Modify` RPC sessions that are of the same
highest Election ID, i.e., "dual-primary" situation in a `SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode.

#### 4.1.4.2 New Primary Election In `SINGLE_PRIMARY`

Switching to a new primary client occurs when a new client connects with
`ModifyRequest.election_id` equals to, or greater than, the previous highest
value that learnt by the server from any client.

Upon discovering a new primary has been elected, the device:

*   SHOULD stop processing pending AFT operations that were sent by the previous
    primary.
*   MUST not send responses for AFT operations of the previous primary to the
    acquiring-primary.

### 4.1.5 Persistence modes

The persistence mode specifies if the device should tie the validity of the
received gRIBI entries from a client to the liveness of the `Modify` RPC
session. [4.1.1](#411-client-server-session-negotiation) defines how the
persistence mode is agreed between client and server.

`Modify` can operate in one of the following modes. The definition of
"disconnects" in this section includes timeout and cancellation of the `Modify`
RPC session.

*   `DELETE` - When a client disconnects, the device should deletes all gRIBI
    entries, received from that client, in RIB and FIB.
*   `PRESERVE` - A client's disconnection SHOULD NOT trigger the device to
    delete any gRIBI entry, received from that client, in RIB or FIB.

No matter which mode the `Modify` RPC session is operating in, it is always the
new primary client's (in case of [`SINGLE_PRIMARY`](\(#414-redundancy-mode\)))
or other clients' (in case of [`ALL_PRIMARY`](#414-redundancy-mode))
responsibility to do the reconciliation (e.g. via [`Get`](#42-get-rpc) and
[`Modify`](#41-modify-rpc) RPC).

### 4.1.6 Acknowledgement Mode

The acknowledgement mode indicates when a response should be sent to a client as
the result of executing the received AFT operations.
[4.1.1](#411-client-server-session-negotiation) defines how the mode is agreed
between client and server.

`Modify` can operate in one of the following acknowledgement modes:

*   `RIB_ACK`: After sending an AFT operation, the client expects the device to
    respond whether if the AFT operation has been successfully programmed in the
    RIB.
*   `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK`: After sending an AFT operation, the client expects the
    device to respond whether if the AFT operation has been successfully
    programmed in both RIB and FIB.

The response is reflected in `AFTResult.status` (see
[4.1.3.2](#4132-aft-operation-response)).

### 4.1.7 About gRIBI Server Caching

gRIBI server implementation is not required to cache entries that have been
removed, or invalidated by the system.

The implication of this is that:

*   When a VRF is removed (e.g. accidentally by user via cli):
    *   The device is not required to maintain gRIBI objects in the FIB or RIB.
    *   New `Get`([4.2](#42-get-rpc)) or `Flush`([4.3](#43-flush-rpc)) should
        return corresponding errors (because the VRF is no longer there)
    *   When the VRF is added back, the server is not required to restore all
        the gRIBI objects without an explicit client request.
    *   Since these external actions (e.g., configuration changes) can impact
        whether a particular entry is being used by the server, the client MAY
        monitor the state of the selected entries via subscribing to the
        Abstract Forwarding Table (AFT) information via gNMI Subscribe.

### 4.1.8 gRIBI Route Preference

A device might learn routing information of the same destination from different
protocols (e.g., static route, gRIBI, OSPF, BGP, etc.), and prefer one over the
others. The preference is normally indicated by different values (often known as
Administrative Distance or Route Preference) in a network device OS. The values
are locally significant to different device OS.

This spec does not enforce the exact value that a device OS should assign to
gRIBI protocol, but the value MUST be configurable.

## 4.2 `Get` RPC

The `Get` RPC is a server streaming RPC for clients to retrieve the current set
of installed gRIBI entries. The `Get` RPC is typically used for reconciliation
between a client and a server, or for periodic consistency checking by clients.

A client sends a `GetRequest` message specifying the target network instance and
gRIBI entry type. The device processes the request and responds a stream of
`GetResponse` messages that contain the set of currently installed gRIBI entries
by any client, and their server acknowledged programming status (see
[4.1.6](#416-acknowledge-mode) for more details). Once all entries have been
sent, the server should close the RPC.

### 4.2.1 `GetRequest` message

`GetRequest` message MUST have both `network_instance` and `aft` populated by
client.

*   If `network_instance` is nil or `network_instance.name` is an empty string,
    the server should close the `Get` RPC with the generic gRPC
    [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
*   If `aft` is set to `ALL`, the device should return all installed gRIBI
    entries in the specified network instance.
*   If `aft` is set to a specific `AFTType`, the device should return all
    installed gRIBI entries of the specified type in the specified network
    instance.
*   If `aft` is set to a specific `AFTType` that's not supported by the device,
    , the device should close the `Get` RPC with the generic gRPC
    [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

### 4.2.2 `GetResponse` message

A `GetResponse` contains a list of `AFTEntry` messages. An `AFTEntry` message
represents an installed gRIBI entry (the data model is defined in
[section 2](#2-data-model)) and its server acknowledged programming status
(`rib_status` and `fib_status`). "server acknowledged programming status"
represents the `AFTResult` at the time of the response being sent to the client
(regardless if sending the response failed).

*   `rib_status` indicates the programming status of the gRIBI entry in RIB. The
    value should be either `PROGRAMMED` or `NOT_PROGRAMMED`.
*   `fib_status` indicates the programming status of the gRIBI entry in FIB.
    *   When the session parameter is `ack_type` = `RIB_ACK`, it's optional for
        the device to keep track of FIB programming status of each gRIBI entry.
        Therefore, this field MAY be set to `UNAVAILABLE`.
    *   When the session parameter is `ack_type` = `RIB_AND_FIB_ACK`, the value
        should be either `PROGRAMMED` or `NOT_PROGRAMMED`.

If the specified network instances have no installed gRIBI objects, the device
should return an empty list of `AFTEntry` and then close the RPC with the
generic gRPC [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to `OK`.

## 4.3 `Flush` RPC

The `Flush` RPC is an unary RPC for clients to remove gRIBI entries from a
device in bulk. A client sends a `FlushRequest` message specifying the target
network instance where the device should remove all gRIBI entries. The device
processes the request and responds a `FlushResponse` message indicating the
execution result.

The `Flush` RPC can be used in some emergency process to get the device out of
undesirable routing state, therefore:

*   This RPC provides a low complexity method to remove all gRIBI entries in
    specified network instance.
*   This RPC allows non primary client (in `SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode) to remove all
    gRIBI entries in specified network instance.

### 4.3.1 `FlushRequest` Message

A `FlushRequest` message MUST have the `network_instance` populated by client.

*   If `network_instance` is nil or `network_instance.name` is an empty string,
    the device should reject the request with gRPC error
    [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The
    `Status.details` should contain `FlushResponseError` message with `reason`
    set to `INVALID_NETWORK_INSTANCE`.
*   If the specified network instance does not exist, the device should reject
    the request with gRPC error [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to
    `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The `Status.details` should contain `FlushResponseError`
    message with `reason` set to `NO_SUCH_NETWORK_INSTANCE`.

#### 4.3.1.1 `election` In `FlushRequest` Message

The client MUST populate the `election` field when the server is in
`SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode (defined in [4.1.4](#414-redundancy-mode)).

*   If the `election` is set when the client-server is in `ALL_PRIMARY` mode
    (defined in [4.1.4](#414-redundancy-mode)), the request should be rejected
    by the device with gRPC error [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to
    `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The `Status.details` should contain
    `FlushResponseError` message with `reason` set to
    `ELECTION_ID_IN_ALL_PRIMARY`.
*   If the `election` is not set when the client-server is in `SINGLE_PRIMARY`
    mode, the request should be rejected by the device with gRPC error
    [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The
    `Status.details` should contain `FlushResponseError` message with `reason`
    set to `UNSPECIFIED_ELECTION_BEHAVIOR`.

When the client-server is in `SINGLE_PRIMARY` mode:

*   If `election` is `id`, the server should process the flush request only if
    the request is from the primary client.
    *   If the `id` value is equal or greater to the previous highest device
        known `election_id` (see [4.1.2](#412-election-id)), the flush request
        should be accepted by the server.
    *   if the `id` value is less than the previous highest device known
        `election_id`, the flush request should be rejected by the server with
        gRPC error [`Status.code`][gRPC status code] set to
        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The `Status.details` should contain
        `FlushResponseError` message with `reason` set to `NOT_PRIMARY`.
*   If `election` is `override`, the flush request should be accepted by the
    device regardless if the client is the primary.

### 4.3.2 `FlushResponse` message

The `timestamp` is when the flush operation completed on the device. It is set
by the device in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.

If the device has removed all gRIBI entries in the client specified network
instance, the device should set `FlushResponse.result` to `OK`.

It is possible that the client targeted network instance contains Next Hops or
Next Hop Groups that are referenced by other network instances not specified by
the client. We call those Next Hops and Next Hop Groups non-zero-referenced. The
device SHOULD keep the non-zero-referenced, but remove all other gRIBI entries
in the specified network instance. In this case, the device should set
`FlushResponse.result` to `NON_ZERO_REFERENCE_REMAIN`.

### 4.3.3 Error Handling

Error encountered by the device removing a gRIBI entry SHOULD NOT block the
device from continuing the effort removing other gRIBI entries, unless the error
is a fatal error (e.g. daemon/job crash).

If any error encountered during the operation, the device should return gRPC
error with `Status.code` set to `INTERNAL`.
