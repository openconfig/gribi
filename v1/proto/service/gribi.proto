  // The network element selects the client with the highest
  // election_id as the primary. If the election_id sent by the
  // client matches the previous highest value, the newer client is
  // considered master, in order to allow for a client to reconnect
  // without an external election having taken place.
  //
  // Upon discovering a failover, the server:
  //  * SHOULD stop processing pending AFTOperations that were sent by

  //    to the acuiquiring-master.
